## User Research Summary

The target audience you hope to reach with your story:

My target audience is voters that care about the impacts of climate change on people around the world. The problem that I am identifying is so large and will impact so many people, it is difficult to limit my audience too narrowly. Many voters already have an idea of what the impacts of climate change will be, but do not have the exact story. 

Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:

I work in water policy, so I know I had to find people outside of work that would have less of an existing knowledge of this issue. To find individuals that are representative of this target audience, I asked people that I knew, friends or acquaintances, that consistently vote but are not as familiar with climate science or impacts as I am. 

Your interview script:

During the interview I asked them the following questions as I went through the wireframe presentation and a few new sketches of my data visualizations: 1) what do you think this story is based on my title? 2) What information do you get from this chart? 3) Do you understand what this chart is saying? 4) What conclusions do you draw from these charts taken together? 5) Would this story motivate you to take an action?

The findings from your interviews:

My interviews gave me some valuable feedback, particularly about my data visualizations. The main feedback that I received was that my labels on my data did not tell the reader what was going on. Not only will I need to adjust the labels themselves, but I will also need to describe the charts further in the text to give more context for those that want to know more. I also received the feedback that my map visualizations did not give them as good of a picture of change in water access over time as they wanted with the existing color scheme (gray to blue), and they wanted to see the negative areas highlighted with a different color. Finally, I got the feedback that I really needed to narrow my focus if I wanted to present this to a large group in a very small amount of time. 

Changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified:

First, I changed the labels on my first chart to be simpler and I moved the more complex descriptions to the text below. Second, I changed the order of some of my visuals so that there is a simple graph that gives a summary of my first in point (rising story drama) and then goes into more detail with a map. I also changed to color scheme of the first maps (red to blue) to better show the countries that have lower water access. Finally, I removed the urbanization aspect of my project to just focus on the impacts of climate change to tell a simpler story.
