# Data

For this project I plan to use data from two sources: UNICEF Reports on Global Water Access and Urbanization and the Global Freshwater Initiative, a Program of the Standford Woods Institute for the Environment. I chose these sources because they had comprehensive yet simple data on clean drinking water access over time around the world and an assessment on future freshwater availability in the global south.

UNICEF: https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/

Global Freshwater Initiative: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/10/104014/pdf

I plan to use the UNICEF data on basic drinking water access in the global south from 2000 to 2017, data on percent change in urbanization, and change in piping (water infrastructure). I plan to extract data from the information from the map on page 6 to display freshwater vulnerabilities in the global south. Comparing these data, I will tell the story of progress and future challenges of water access for populations in the global south. 

# Method and Medium

I plan to display my data using Shorthand. For graphics involving a map I found infogram easy to use and plan on using that platform to create an interactive map of the global south. To show trends in urbanization and increasingly inadequate water infrastructure I plan to use Datawrapper's arrow plot or dot plot.

## User Research Summary

The target audience you hope to reach with your story:

My target audience is voters that care about the impacts of climate change on people around the world. The problem that I am identifying is so large and will impact so many people, it is difficult to limit my audience too narrowly. Many voters already have an idea of what the impacts of climate change will be, but do not have the exact story. 

Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:

I work in water policy, so I know I had to find people outside of work that would have less of an existing knowledge of this issue. To find individuals that are representative of this target audience, I asked people that I knew, friends or acquaintances, that consistently vote but are not as familiar with climate science or impacts as I am. 

Your interview script:

During the interview I asked them the following questions as I went through the wireframe presentation and a few new sketches of my data visualizations: 1) what do you think this story is based on my title? 2) What information do you get from this chart? 3) Do you understand what this chart is saying? 4) What conclusions do you draw from these charts taken together? 5) Would this story motivate you to take an action?

The findings from your interviews:

My interviews gave me some valuable feedback, particularly about my data visualizations. The main feedback that I received was that my labels on my data did not tell the reader what was going on. Not only will I need to adjust the labels themselves, but I will also need to describe the charts further in the text to give more context for those that want to know more. I also received the feedback that my map visualizations did not give them as good of a picture of change in water access over time as they wanted with the existing color scheme (gray to blue), and they wanted to see the negative areas highlighted with a different color. Finally, I got the feedback that I really needed to narrow my focus if I wanted to present this to a large group in a very small amount of time. 

Changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified:

First, I changed the labels on my first chart to be simpler and I moved the more complex descriptions to the text below. Second, I changed the order of some of my visuals so that there is a simple graph that gives a summary of my first in point (rising story drama) and then goes into more detail with a map. I also changed to color scheme of the first maps (red to blue) to better show the countries that have lower water access. Finally, I removed the urbanization aspect of my project to just focus on the impacts of climate change to tell a simpler story.  


## Final Data Story

The audience for this project is voters. As a local water justice organizer it is my job to reach out to, educate, and organize residents around water issues that matter to them. I frequently give presentations to the community about local and regional water issues so I assumed the same level of knowledge and crafted a presentation that would make sense to the community members that I meet with on a regular basis. I did this by changing the labels to be extremely simple and explaining the graphics in further detial in the narrative sections of the project if they were interested in learning more. I also had a very simple narrative arc that made both the building story and the threats facing water access very cut and dry, while leaving room for hope at the end if people come together. 

I had to try out different graphs and work with data that was collected slightly differently from 1990 to now to create the line graph showing water access over time. Previously, the Limited Access category was 3 different categories, and No Safe Access was described as basically either severly contaminated or surface water, which were more difficult concepts to describe. The maps were fairly straight forward in the end. I tried out different ways to show the growth in certain countries, but I could never get the right look with all of the countries I wanted to include just listed out. I decided to go with a red to blue map to highlight both the areas that needed improvement and got in over the 17 year period and to also show that many areas around the world already have near universal access to safe water. 

Next, I had to show the projected change in water scarcity which was a bit difficult with the GIS map. The map series shows water scarcity by basin which is the more scientific way to show it, although in the end I don't think the map series really highlights the increase in water stress as much as I wanted it to. The graphic beneath that map series does a much better job at showing the severity and showing other angles like the impact on agriculture that some readers may not think of when they think of water scarcity. Finally, the icon graphic showing the proportion of people that are projected to live in water scarcity according to the United Nations does the best job, I think, at showing what the human impact will be. If I had more time and space I would also include a graphic showing the projected migration patterns that will result around the world from both areas that will soon be below sea level and areas that will no longer have any access to freshwater for drinking.
